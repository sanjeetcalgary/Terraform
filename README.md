# Workflow
- Terraform init: initializes a working directory containing Terraform configuration files.
- Terraform validate: validates the configuration files in a directory, referring only to the configuration and not accessing any remote services
- Terraform plan: will display the steps that will be taken by terraform on resources
- Terraform apply: perform the steps on resources
- Terraform destroy: will destroy the resources managed by terraform

## Terraform resources
They have arguments, attributes and meta-arguments
- Arguments: Used to configure a specific resource, `<Identifier>=<Expression>`
- Attributes: Data that belongs to an object, `<aws_instance.example.id>`
- meta-arguments: Used to customize behaviour of modules and resources, not resource specific `count, depends_on, provider, lifecycle, provisioner, data etc. `

-----------------------------------------------
- Terraform automatically creates or updates the dependency lock file each time you run the terraform init command. 
- The lock file is named as `.terraform.lock.hcl`
- This file contains information like version, constraints, hashes, provider

-----------------------------------------------
## Provider Authentication
- As parameter

- As environment variable
    ![Alt text](image-1.png)
- As config files located at `$~/.aws/config`

--------------------------------------------
## Resource behavior
When Terraform creates a new infrastructure object represented by a resource block, the identifier for that real object is saved in Terraform's state, allowing it to be updated and destroyed in response to future changes.

Applying Terraform configuration will:
- Create resources that exist in the configuration but are not associated with a real infrastructure object in the state.
- Destroy resources that exist in the state but no longer exist in the configuration
- Update in-place resources whose arguments have changed
- Destroy and re-create resources whose arguments have changed but which cannot be updated in-place due to remote API limitations.

`Accessing resource attributes: <RESOURCE TYPE>.<NAME>.<ATTRIBUTE>`

## Meta-Arguments
They are used to change resource behaviour
- depends_on: This argument allows you to specify dependencies between resources , example- you want webserver to be created after database
    ![Alt text](image-3.png)
- count: This argument allows to create multiple instances of a module or a resource
    ![Alt text](image-4.png)
- for_each: This argument allows you to create multiple instances of a resource or module using a list or map of values. This can be useful for creating resources based on dynamic input data.
    ![Alt text](image-5.png)
    	each.key — The map key (or set member) corresponding to this instance
    	each.value — The map value corresponding to this instance. (If a set was provided, this is the same as each.key
- provisioner: This argument allows you to run custom scripts or programs on a resource after it has been created. This is useful for tasks such as installing software on a virtual machine or configuring a database
    ![Alt text](image-6.png)
- Output: This argument allows you to define custom output values for a module or resource. These output values can be accessed from other modules or resources, or displayed to the user when running the terraform apply command.
    ![Alt text](image-7.png)
- Connection: This argument allows you to specify connection details for a resource that requires access to other resources or external services.
    ![Alt text](image-8.png)
- on_failure: This argument allows you to specify a custom behavior for when a resource fails to be created or destroyed. This can be useful for handling errors or cleaning up after failed operations.

------------------------------------------------
## Lifecycle 
used to manage the lifecycle of a resource. It provides a way to specify additional behavior that affects how Terraform handles changes to a resource.
- create_before_destroy: This boolean value determines whether Terraform creates a new resource before destroying the old one. If set to true, Terraform will create a new resource before destroying the old one. This is useful for resources that can’t be updated in place, such as databases.
![Alt text](image-12.png)

- prevent_destroy: This boolean value determines whether Terraform can destroy a resource. If set to true, Terraform will prevent the resource from being destroyed. This is useful for resources that should never be deleted, such as production databases or key management systems.
to delete, we have to remove this resource declaration section from config file and then when we apply , resource will be deleted

- ignore_changes: This list of attributes determines which resource attributes Terraform should ignore when determining whether a change has occurred. If an attribute is listed here, Terraform will ignore changes to that attribute and not try to update it.

- replace_triggered_by: 
-----------------------------------------------
- State file: It is a mapping between configuration file and resource on cloud
- State file is a JSON file consisting of provider version, CLI version, Output, Resources detail
- `terraform.tfstate.backup`- Another file created with terraform apply command
- This file is like a version of the tfstate file. Whenever we modify something on our code and apply it, our tfstate file will change our resources’ information. At that point this backup file acts as an old version of the state file. So the modified resources details are in the tfstate file, and the old tfstate file will be transferred to tfstate.backup file

- Desired State: Local Terraform Manifest (All *.tf files)
- Current State: Real Resources present in your cloud
